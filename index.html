<li>Although 2017 has the largest amount of revenue, most are coming from new customers.</li>
<li>Growth from 2016 mostle depended on new customers also, since there were only $9,333,573.44 coming from existing customers.</li>
<li>There are not a lot of data over the time, it is harder to make prediction. However, from the trend from these two years, existing customers do not bring much revenue; therefore, the company should focus more on new customers.</li>
